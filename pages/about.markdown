# About

Hi! Welcome to my website. My name is Trace Dressen, and I'm a recent graduate from Carnegie Mellon University where I studied Entertainment Technology. Aside from my studies, I've worked in such places as Walt Disney World Resort's Design & Engineering group and Universal Creative. I have always had a great passion for immersive entertainment, whether that means theme parks, video games, or other exciting experiences. Take a look at my portfolio to see some of the games and experiences I've been working on.
