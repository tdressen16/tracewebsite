# Deception Game
**Team Size**: 8 Members  
**Role**: Game Designer, Programmer  
**Engine**: Unreal  
**Platform**: PC  
**Duration**: 3 Months  

## Project Description
Starting over the summer, a group of friends and I started working on a deception game (along the lines of Among Us) in Unreal Engine 4. The basic concept would see two teams trying to collect parts of a code that, when completed, would win them the game. However, each team has a mole that's secretly working for the other side.

## Contributions
As a **game designer**, I've been working with my team in many aspects of the game, including initial brainstorming, as well as developing further mechanics and ideas.

In addition to helping with overall game design for this project, I've been working as a **programmer**, creating an AI security guard using Unreal's Blueprints system and behavior trees.
